# Vulnerability response

- Vulnerability response should be redirected to Monero because much of Aeon's technical ground is shared
- Our [Vulnerability Response Process](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/blob/master/VULNERABILITY_RESPONSE_PROCESS.md) encourages responsible disclosure
- We are also available via [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/monero)
